# JavaScript Projects

I've been studying JavaScript by building projects.
Here are lists of projects down below.

## Web_Map

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/yelee/pen/yzpxgwr?editors=1111)
This is the project that shows informations about several restaurants and parks on map. This is mainly focussed on a feature that any informations and places can be added dynamically in the array without needing to change or add a lot of codes.
