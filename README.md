# JavaScript Projects

I've been studying JavaScript by building projects.
Here are lists of projects down below.

## Web_Map

This is the project that shows informations about several restaurants and parks on the map. This is mainly focussed on an algorithm feature that additional informations and places can be dynamically added in the array without needing to change or add a lot of codes.

## Quiz_App

This is the quiz that recommends a user where user should travel based on their preference. Each question tells what a user like. For example, If you like movie "Sex and the city" over "Mamamia", It assumes that you'd like to beach over city. It sends the data of user's choice to Airtable and reads back aggregate results from Airtable, and use D3.js to make a chart. Additional question can be easily added without changing a lot and writing new codes. You can try this quiz here [Codepen](https://codepen.io/yelee/pen/ZEBXpMV?editors=1011)
