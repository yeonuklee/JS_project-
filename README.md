# JavaScript Projects

I've been studying JavaScript by building projects.
Here is  a list of projects:

## Web_Map

This project shows information about several restaurants and parks on the map. This is mainly focused on an algorithm where additional where places and their associated information can be dynamically added in the array without needing to write a lot of code.

## Quiz_App

This quiz recommends where a user should travel based on their preferences. Each question asks what a user likes. For example, If you like movie "Sex and the City" over "Mama Mia!", then it assumes that you'd like to explore the city over the beach. It sends the user's answer to an Airtable database and outputs the results. D3.js is then used to visualize the data via a bar chart. Additional questions can be easily added without writing a lot of code. You can try this quiz here: [Codepen](https://codepen.io/yelee/pen/ZEBXpMV?editors=1011)
