# JavaScript Projects

I've been studying JavaScript by building projects.
Here are lists of projects down below.

## Web_Map

This is the project that shows informations about several restaurants and parks on map. This is mainly focussed on an algorithm feature that additional informations and places can be dynamically added in the array without needing to change or add a lot of codes.
